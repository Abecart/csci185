					<h2>More Peices</h2>
					<p>
						Wlecome to another page full of stuff I have been working on, this page is kinda of blank but will be ever changing as I add in more and more about myself. 
						The reason behind this is that I feel I have accomplished so much throughout my last semester as a Junior at UNCA. I will be going forth and adding more things as they come because of how this has turned out. 
						Lasty, these peices of work are created mainly by photoshop and illustrator, the reason for them being on here is me growing as an artist and feeling proud of my work, I know there are peices on the first page, but please 
						enjoy these as well.
