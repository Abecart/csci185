											<h3>About Abram</h3>
										</header>
										<p>So, I am a 20 year old college studnet who lives in Asheville, North Carolina, though I was orginally born in Greensboro NC. I have 4 siblings, a twin sister, two younger sisters and a younger brother. Growing up in Asheville I there are several things I enjoy including going outside, listening to music and hanging out with others. </p>
										<p>I have always had a passion for art and graphic and interior design. Though I am not going to school for any of those things, I am still learning those skills in everyday life. I am currently a Mass Communication major with a New Media minor at UNC Asheville, it has been very interesting, but I have learned several things from each that will help me in my future career and plans.</p> 
										<p>I currently work at the UNC Asheville Career Center where I learned to put my passion and skills into a job. I make stickers, market ideas, talk to people and even help with designing flyers, even though I do all that, I mainly take headshots for the Career Center and help students update their profiles. For my day to day life I try to stay busy
											mainly becuase that helps me with getting things done consistantly.  </p>
