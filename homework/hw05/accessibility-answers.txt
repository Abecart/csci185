1. What corrections did you have to make?

I had to fix the label section of the portfolio, which was very confusing

1. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?

I don't think it would be, sense the css itself is what holds the index together to be able to see and be useable

1. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?

Yes, as of a few minutes ago using it, the site seems to be tabbable. If not, then I might have done something incorrect



Reminder: don't forget to include a screenshot of your Wave report and link to it from your homepage!
